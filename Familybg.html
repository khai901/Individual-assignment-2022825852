			<h2>My Family Background</h2>

			<br>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">I was born into a modesty family with nine siblings, and my upbringing instilled in me the spirit of hard work and determination. My mother is a full-time housewife, dedicating her life to our family, whereas my father works as a contractor to bring food to our table. Being the fourth child in the family, I always had to strive for a balance between my responsibilities and aspirations.</h3>

			<br>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">My eldest brother completed his studies in 2016 and has been a role model to me through his will and achievements, while my older sister, in spite of being a full-time working professional, is pursuing her master's via a part-time distance learning program, which further signifies the importance of lifelong learning to me. The other brother stays in Melaka, pursuing his degree studies with much dedication, proving to be an excellent example for the younger siblings.</h3>

			<br>

			<h3 style="text-align:center;">As for myself, I am about to complete my diploma, and it makes my family very happy and proud. For siblings, the one closest in proximity to me finished SPM some time ago and now he continues on at KPTM. Younger siblings - the last four of us are considered to be among those children struggling through both their primary and secondary school days, filled with excitement.</h3>

			<br>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">This big family has taught me so much how to work with people, respect them, and support them throughout their lives.</h3>
